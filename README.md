# Assignment

This repository contains the analysis and modeling tasks for customer data, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), lookalike modeling, and customer segmentation.

## Files Overview

### 1. Jahnvi_Sahni_EDA.ipynb
- **Description**: Jupyter Notebook containing the exploratory data analysis of the customer and transaction data.
- **Contents**: Data cleaning, visualization, and initial insights into customer behavior and product trends.

### 2. Jahnvi_Sahni_EDA.pdf
- **Description**: PDF version of the EDA notebook.
- **Contents**: Includes all the analysis and visualizations from the EDA notebook for easy sharing and review.

### 3. Jahnvi_Sahni_Lookalike.py
- **Description**: Python script for building a Lookalike Model.
- **Contents**: Code to identify similar customers based on profile and transaction history, including similarity scores.

### 4. Jahnvi_Sahni_Lookalike.csv
- **Description**: CSV file containing the lookalike results.
- **Contents**: Lists the top 3 similar customers for each customer, along with their similarity scores.

### 5. Jahnvi_Sahni_Clustering.ipynb
- **Description**: Jupyter Notebook for customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
- **Contents**: Implementation of clustering algorithms, evaluation metrics, and visualizations of customer segments.

### 6. Jahnvi_Sahni_Clustering.pdf
- **Description**: PDF version of the clustering notebook.
- **Contents**: Includes all the analysis and visualizations from the clustering notebook for easy sharing and review.

## Usage

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to explore the code and results interactively.
- **Python Script**: Run the `.py` file in a Python environment to execute the lookalike model.
- **PDF Files**: View the `.pdf` files for a static version of the analysis and results.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jahnvisahni31/Data_science_assignment.git
   cd Data_science_assignment
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
   - Install required libraries for notebooks and scripts using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Explore EDA**:
   - Open and run `Jahnvi_Sahni_EDA.ipynb` for interactive analysis.
   - Alternatively, review `Jahnvi_Sahni_EDA.pdf` for a non-interactive version.

4. **Run Lookalike Model**:
   - Execute `Jahnvi_Sahni_Lookalike.py` to generate lookalike results.
   - Review the output in `Jahnvi_Sahni_Lookalike.csv`.

5. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Open and run `Jahnvi_Sahni_Clustering.ipynb` for interactive customer segmentation.
   - Alternatively, review `Jahnvi_Sahni_Clustering.pdf` for a non-interactive version.
